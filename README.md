# IoT-Intelligent_Inventory_System

The **Intelligent Inventory System** project is an innovative solution that leverages **RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)** technology and **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)** to manage inventory efficiently. This system utilizes **RFID tags** placed on each product to track and identify items in real-time. Through the **MQTT protocol**, inventory information can be synchronized directly with the database, enabling accurate and timely inventory management. With this technology integration, the project aims to enhance operational efficiency and reduce inventory errors, thereby speeding up decision-making processes and increasing overall productivity.
